# telcosql

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis in SQL with CRUD, sorting, filtering, aggregate, and join functions on a Telco customer churn dataset in derive data-driven insight to answer the question: "Why are customers leaving this Telco company?" Then, I visualized interesting insights by creating a Tableau dashboard to present business insights and suggestions in a visually-appealing manner.
